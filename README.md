LD23 : Disregard All Humans
====

A repo to hold my Ludum Dare 23 Entry, which I've named **Disregard All Humans**, after the original competition's theme, "*Tiny World*". 
Destroy cities, eat humans and grow large enough to consume the earth! 

It shouldn't take you too long to get through the whole thing :)

**This is a work in progress!**

About Ludum Dare

About the Ludum Dare (from Wikipedia):

Ludum Dare (from Latin "to give a game") is also known as LD48, and is an accelerated game development competition. It was founded by Geoff Howland and was first held in April 2002. Participants are given 48 hours to create a game from scratch fitting a theme announced at the start of the contest. All of the code and content must be created during the 48 hours, each entry must be created by a single person and source code must be shown. After the competition ends, participants are given 3 weeks to play and rate games created by their peers. There are no physical or cash prizes but participants retain full ownership of their entries.

This is the first time I participate on the Ludum Dare (and also first time using Lua, and Love2D).
